In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using the `FlatList` component with a complex data structure and dynamic rendering.  If the data changes frequently, and the `renderItem` function isn't optimized to handle these changes efficiently, it might lead to unexpected behavior. For example, consider a scenario where the items in the `FlatList` are objects with nested properties. If a nested property changes, the `FlatList` might not re-render the corresponding item correctly, leading to stale data being displayed. This is because `FlatList` relies on key extraction to efficiently update only the necessary items. If the key doesn't change when a nested property changes, the item might not be updated properly, resulting in stale data.
