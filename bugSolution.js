The solution involves creating a unique key for each item that incorporates the nested properties.  One method is to use JSON.stringify to convert the relevant part of the data structure into a string and use it as the key. Here is an improved `renderItem` function:

```javascript
renderItem = ({ item }) => {
  const uniqueKey = JSON.stringify(item.nestedProperty);
  return (
    <View key={uniqueKey}>
      {/* ... your item rendering logic ... */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

This approach ensures that the key changes whenever the `nestedProperty` changes, forcing `FlatList` to re-render the item with the updated data.  This approach might not be ideal for extremely large datasets, as JSON.stringify can be computationally expensive. For better performance, consider creating a unique ID for each item that is updated when relevant nested properties change.
